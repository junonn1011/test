   <h1>Catering</h1>

  <p> A mobile restaurant is a great alternative for catering your 
   wedding, event, or party. We do more than just deliver, we
   prepare your food from fresh ingredients and deliver it hot.
   Mobile Panini is ideal for those venues that lack an 
   on-site food concession.
   </p>
   <p> Consider us for:
     
     <ul>

        <li>Weddings</li>
        <li>Fund raisers</li>
        <li> Athletic Events</li>
        <li> Birthday Parties</li>
        <li> Sales Events</li>
        <li> ... and much more!</li>
      </ul>
   </p> 
  <p>Choose from our standard catering menu or call us to develop a
   customized menu for your special party or event. We're fast and
   we're flexible.
